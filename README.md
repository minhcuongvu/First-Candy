# Technical Challenge Part 1

You have to create a simple mobile friendly web-application (Single-Page Application) – working title: “My Community Landmark” - that allows users to save location based notes on a map. These notes can be
displayed on the map where they were saved and viewed by the user that created the note as well as other users of the application. The application must demonstrate the functionality captured in the following user stories:

1. As a user (of the application) I can see my current location on a map
2. As a user I can save a short note at my current location
3. As a user I can see notes that I have saved at the location they were saved
   on the map
4. As a user I can see the location, text, and user-name of notes other users
   have saved
5. As a user I have the ability to search for a note based on contained text or
   user-name
   Your application does not need to be pretty (i.e. artist designed) but you should
   aim to make it as functional and usable as possible within the given constraints.
